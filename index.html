<p>I am an M.S. student in computer science at UIUC, fortunately advised by Dr. Hanghang Tong. Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. degree in industrial engineering at Tsinghua.</p>
<p>My research interests lie broadly in graph-based machine learning and its applications, including stochastic processes and combinatorial optimization on graphs.</p>
